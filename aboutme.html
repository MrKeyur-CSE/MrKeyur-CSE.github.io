                    <h1>Keyur Panchal</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Keyur, and I am a graduate in Computer Science and Engineering with a strong
                        technical foundation and hands-on experience in web development. I am a highly motivated and
                        detail-oriented individual with a passion for building innovative digital solutions and a
                        continuous drive for learning and self-improvement. </p>

                    <p>While I have explored various areas within computer science, my current focus is on cloud
                        computing, where I aim to deepen my expertise and pursue a long-term career. I am actively
                        developing my skills through certifications, hands-on projects, and industry research to stay
                        aligned with the evolving technology landscape.</p>

                    <p>Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy engaging in creative pursuits such as playing
                        video games and watching anime and films. I am also a passionate follower of the Marvel
                        Cinematic
                        Universe and a devoted coffee enthusiast, always eager to learn, grow, and take on new
                        challenges. </p>

                    <p>
                        I strongly advocate for the mobile-first approach, which is what initially inspired me to pursue
                        app development. My passion for technology also extends into gaming—playing PC games with a
                        diverse community not only fuels my creativity but has helped me build a strong and engaging
                        network. This hobby led me to collaborate with some of India’s top gaming YouTubers, assisting
                        them with stream edits and UI/UX design work. As an enthusiast in user interface and experience
                        design, I’ve continued to sharpen my creative skills through these collaborations. I also took
                        full ownership of the UI/UX design for my final year project, further demonstrating my ability
                        to merge functionality with aesthetic design.

                                Through the Virtualization and Cloud Computing course, I am gaining a strong

                                how to work with virtualization technologies such as hypervisors, virtual machines, and
                                containers to improve system efficiency and scalability. The course is helping me become
                                familiar with different cloud service models—like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS—as well as
                                various
                                deployment models including public, private, and hybrid clouds. I’m also developing

                                skills in setting up virtual environments, deploying and managing cloud-based solutions,

                                ensuring data and network security within cloud systems. Additionally, I’m learning to

                                cloud performance, manage costs, and implement automation and orchestration tools that

                                essential for supporting agile and scalable IT operations.

                                I graduated with a degree in <span>Computer Science and Engineering </span> in 2021.
                                During my
                                undergraduate studies, I developed a strong passion for Cloud Computing, which led me to
                                explore the field beyond the classroom. I actively participated in various seminars,
                                webinars, and online certification courses to deepen my understanding of cloud
                                technologies and industry practices. This continuous learning journey earned me the role
                                of a <span>Google Cloud Facilitator</span> at my college, where I was responsible for
                                mentoring and
                                training fellow students on Google Cloud fundamentals, tools, and best practices. This
                                experience not only strengthened my technical knowledge but also enhanced my leadership,
                                communication, and presentation skills.

                                Currently, I am preparing for the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification
                                exam to further validate my technical competencies and stay aligned with current
                                industry demands. In addition, I worked with a team to design and develop an Android
                                mobile application as part of my final year capstone project. This project allowed me to
                                apply my programming skills in a real-world context, while gaining practical experience
                                in mobile development, UI/UX design, and collaborative software engineering practices.

                                I am deeply committed to continuous learning and professional growth, with a keen
                                interest in cloud-native technologies, DevOps practices, and scalable software
                                solutions.
